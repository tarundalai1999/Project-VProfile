  Description:

The role entails spearheading the development and maintenance of robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines tailored specifically for containerized applications. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Helm, and other relevant tools, you'll orchestrate seamless automation across the workflow, striving for a 95% automation rate.

Ensuring the quality and security of the codebase is paramount. You'll aim for a minimum of 90% code coverage for containerized applications and conduct thorough automated vulnerability scans using SonarQube within the CI/CD pipelines.

Version control and configuration management are central to maintaining consistency and traceability. All container configurations will be versioned and managed meticulously within Git and GitHub repositories, with a target consistency rate of 98% across environments.

Efficiency and agility are core objectives of the role. You'll optimize CI/CD pipelines to drastically reduce deployment time by at least 50%, facilitating a rapid pace of releases with a minimum frequency of once per day.

Ensuring the reliability and stability of containerized applications is critical. By implementing robust monitoring solutions utilizing Kubernetes and Prometheus, you'll strive for a minimum uptime of 99%. Alerts will be finely tuned to trigger incident response within 5 minutes of detection, ensuring swift resolution of any issues.

Key skills for success in this role include proficiency in Docker, Jenkins, Git, Maven, Helm, SonarQube, Linux, and Kubernetes, along with a strong grasp of CI/CD principles and best practices in containerized environments. The role offers an exciting opportunity to drive innovation and streamline development processes within a dynamic and forward-thinking team.
